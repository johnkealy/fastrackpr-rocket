These are the defaults for the Config Splits.

These can be imported using the drush d-set command if the
dropsolid_rocketship_drush module is enabled.

Make sure ../config/splits/live, ../config/splits/dev, ../config/splits/staging and ../config/splits/local
folders exist. ../ is relative to the docroot.
